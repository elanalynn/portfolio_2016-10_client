    <h3 class="">My name is Elana Kopelevich.</h3>
    <p>
      I am a web developer and an instructor at Galvanize (a coding bootcamp). I used to be a Marketing Director at a solar company and I have a Bachelor’s degree in animation. I also have an interest in design and illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first coding language was JavaScript and I’ve done a fair amount of work with Node, Express, and Angular 1.x. I’ve also explored Ember and React. I am currently building a project with Elixir and Phoenix, and playing with Elm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from coding, I have a tendency to organize community programs. As a Marketing Director, I headed a lot of community outreach programs and that work seems to have followed me to my life as a developer. Since starting at Galvanize, I’ve been part of starting a women’s Meetup on two campuses, a mentorship program, and an instructor Lunch n’ Learn program.

    <p>
      I also enjoy (extremely) casual sports, writing, reading and good coffee. I care a lot about animals (making their lives better), and education for everyone. Most importantly, I am passionate about learning.
