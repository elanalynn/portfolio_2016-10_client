          <p>I am a web developer with marketing and design skills. I am about to finish the Galvanize Full Stack program in Denver, CO. As I approach graduation, I'm looking to start a conversation with a forward-thinking company that seeks an honest, determined, junior developer.</p>

          <p>I have a solid foundation semantic HTML5, responsive CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Knex, RESTful Design, Git and Agile Methodologies. Iâ€™ve also explored Ruby on Rails, Python and Swift. I am comfortable asking targeted questions, finding answers in documentation and experimenting with solutions a logical way.</p>

          <p>Prior to entering the world of web development, I had a successful career in marketing. In that past life, I brought together unique skill sets in graphic design, copywriting, illustration, communications and strategic management to drive rapid growth at several organizations. I've worked in corporate and start-up style environments and I've proven to be adaptable, resourceful and helpful on every team.</p>

          <p>I enjoy (extremely) casual sports, illustration, design, writing, reading and drinking good coffee. I also care a lot about animals, education and clean energy. Most importantly, I am passionate about learning.</p>
