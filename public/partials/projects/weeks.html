        <p>I came across a graphical visualization of a life in weeks via<a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank"> waitbutwhy.com</a>. Weeks were represented by simple squares, arranged in rows of 52 to represent a year. I fell in love with the diagram so I immediately printed the page and started marking it up. It wasn’t long before I hit the inevitable limitation of interactivity that comes with a sheet of paper. I thought, wouldn’t this be cool if it was a web application? This is my attempt at making “Your Life in Weeks” interactive.</p>
        <p>I created this for a front-end assignment in the fifth week of bootcamp. I used Bootstrap, jQuery and localStorage to persist the life events to the best of my ability at the time. I am currently working on rewriting this project as a full stack application.</p>

        <p>Features include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
