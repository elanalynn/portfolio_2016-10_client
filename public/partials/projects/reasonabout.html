    <p>Coming from a marketing background, I know that a person is not <span class="italic">always</span> inspired to write original content. I also know that to keep an online space interesting enough to return to again and again, you need a constant flow of original content. One evening, it occured to me that I had 26 peers who were learning to reason about really interesting things every single day. Why shouldn't we combine forces and create a bunch of interesting content in one easy to find place.</p>
    <p>I learned Jekyll and quickly put together a site that my peers could collaborate on. I include this here with my projects, not to wow anyone with my coding (Jekyll is ridiculously easy to use), but to show my initiative to organize and communicate.</p>
